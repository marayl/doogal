Export one or more documents to the outgoing directory:
${DOOGAL_REPO}/outgoing

The outgoing directory may be changed using the 'set' command.

If the Content-Type is "text/wiki" then the exported document will be
converted to HTML.  Otherwise, the raw contents will be written to a plain
text file.
